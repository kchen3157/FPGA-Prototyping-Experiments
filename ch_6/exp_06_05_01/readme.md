# 6.5.1 Early detection debouncing circuit 
## Prompt
Consider the alternative debouncing circuit in Experiment 5.5.2. Redesign the circuit using the RT methodology:
- Derive the ASMD chart for the circuit. 
- Derive the HDL code based on the ASMD chart. 
- Derive a testing circuit similar to that in Section 5.3.3 with the alternative debouncing circuit and verify its operation.
