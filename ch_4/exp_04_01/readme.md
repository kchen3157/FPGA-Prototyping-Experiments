# Experiment 4.8.1 Programmable square wave generator 

## Prompt
A programmable square wave generator is a circuit that can generate a square wave with variable on (i.e., logic ’1’) and off (i.e., logic ’0’) intervals. The durations of the intervals are specified by two 4-bit control signals, m and n, which are interpreted as unsigned integers. The on and off intervals are m\*100 ns and n\*100 ns, respectively (recall that the period of the onboard oscillator is 10 ns). Design a programmable square wave generator circuit. The circuit should be completely synchronous. We need a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to verify its operation.
