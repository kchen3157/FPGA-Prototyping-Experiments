# Experiment 4.8.6 Enhanced stopwatch 
## Prompt
Modify the stopwatch with the following extensions:
- Add an additional signal, up, to control the direction of counting. The stopwatch counts up when the up signal is asserted and counts down otherwise. 
- Add a minute digit to the display. The LED display format should be like M.SS.D, where D represents 0.1 second and its range is between 0 and 9, SS represents seconds and its range is between 00 and 59, and M represents minutes and its range is between 0 and 9. 

Design the new stopwatch and verify its operation with a testing circuit.
