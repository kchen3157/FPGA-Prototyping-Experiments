# Parameterized barrel shifter

## Prompt
The barrel shifter discussed in Section 3.10.3 only accepts an eight-bit input signal. We want to construct a parameterized module, in which the input width can be specified by a parameter. To simplify the design, we assume that width of the input is 2^N and the N is used as the parameter.
1. Design the circuit and derive the code. 
2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code. 
3. Design a testing circuit for a 16-bit input and derive the code. 
4. Synthesize the circuit, program the FPGA, and verify its operation.
