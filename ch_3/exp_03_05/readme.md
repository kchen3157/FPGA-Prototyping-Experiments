# 3.12.5 Floating-point greater-than circuit

A floating-point greater-than circuit compares two floating-point numbers and asserts output, gt, when the first number is larger than the second number. Assume that the two numbers are represented in the format discussed in Section 3.10.4.
1. Design the circuit and derive the code. 
2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code. 
3. Design a testing circuit and derive the code. 
4. Synthesize the circuit, program the FPGA, and verify its operation.
